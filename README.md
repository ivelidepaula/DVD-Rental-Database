# DVD Rental Database

## Project Overview

This project uses SQL queries to analyze a database with data from a DVD rental company. The goal was to complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer your questions, and finishing by sharing your findings.

## Files necessary:
To run successfully your own data analysis you need the following files available in this repository:

- [DVD Rental ER Diagram](https://github.com/ivelidepaula/DVD-Rental-Database/blob/master/dvd-rental-erd-2.png): you need this diagram to check the relationships of entity sets stored in the database.
- [DVD Rental Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/): the public database provided by PostgreSQL Tutorial website.

## Tech used:

You need to install **PostgreSQL** on your local machine to successfully run the queries. A detailed tutorial on how to do it can be found here:  [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/).

## Results

Four queries were  created to answer the following questions: 
 - How many rental orders we have for each category of family movies? 
 - What is the rental count given the rental length for each family-friendly category? 
 - How many rental orders each store has per month? 
 - Who were our top 10 paying customers and how many monthly payments they made in 2007?

This [pdf file](https://github.com/ivelidepaula/DVD-Rental-Database/blob/master/Results.pdf) shows the results I got after running those queries. The file with my own SQL queries is [here](https://github.com/ivelidepaula/DVD-Rental-Database/blob/master/Queries.sql).
